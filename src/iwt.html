                    As the name suggests, computer science engineering is a study that encompasses the theory of computation and the design and implementation of computational systems. This is a course which is offered all over the globe in the best of the technical institutions and a student can do graduation as well as post-graduation degrees.

As part of the computer science and engineering programme, students learn about developing hardware and software systems for computers and gain ample knowledge of communication systems and other similar devices. This is also one of the reasons why CSE engineering graduates are best suited for robotics research.

                </div>Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) involves researching, designing, developing, and testing electronic equipment used in various systems. Electronics and Communications engineers also conceptualise and oversee the manufacturing of communications and broadcast systems. This stream of engineering deals with analogue transmission, basic electronics, microprocessors, solid-state devices, digital and analogue communication, analogue integrated circuits, microwave engineering, satellite communication, antennae, and wave progression. It also deals with the manufacturing of electronic devices, circuits, and communications equipment. In India, Electronics and Communications Engineering is offered by various colleges at the UG as well as PG level leading to BTech (4 years) and MTech (2 years) degrees respectively.

                    Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after the commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution, and use.

Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics/control, and electrical materials science.[a]

                    Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.[1] It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.

                    Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, design, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.[2][3]                </div>
